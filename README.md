# Global Happiness Predictor

The Global Happiness Predictor is a groundbreaking project designed to assess and predict an individual's level of happiness based on globally recognized factors. Leveraging data from the World Happiness Report, this project aims to abstract country-level happiness indicators to a personal scale, offering users insights into the determinants of happiness and a unique tool for self-assessment.

## Project Scope

This project utilises machine learning and web technologies to analyze and predict happiness levels. It incorporates data manipulation, model development, and interactive web application development to provide a comprehensive approach to understanding happiness. The project's scope includes:

- **Data Analysis**: Conducting a thorough analysis of the World Happiness Report data to identify key factors influencing happiness.
- **Machine Learning**: Developing a binary classification model to predict happiness based on user inputs.
- **Web Development**: Creating an interactive application where users can engage with the model, inputting their own data to receive personalized happiness assessments.
- **Visualization**: Incorporating dynamic visualizations to illustrate the factors contributing to happiness and the model's predictions.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the World Happiness Report dataset available on Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness>), which compiles global happiness metrics across several years. This dataset forms the foundation for our analysis and model development, providing a robust framework for understanding the intricacies of happiness on a global scale.

## Technical Requirements

- **Machine Learning Library**: Scikit-learn for model development.
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Python Pandas for dataset handling and manipulation.
- **Visualization**: Python Matplotlib and JavaScript Plotly for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Web Development**: HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for the frontend, with Flask or Django serving as the backend framework.
- **Database** (Optional): SQL Database or MongoDB for storing user inputs and model predictions, enhancing the interactive aspect of the web application.
