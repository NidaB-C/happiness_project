# Global Happiness Predictor

The Global Happiness Predictor aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict an individual's happiness level based on global happiness metrics. By abstracting data from the World Happiness Report to a personal level, this tool offers a unique perspective for self-assessment and understanding happiness determinants.

## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

This project synthesizes data from the World Happiness Report to predict happiness levels on an individual basis. Through exploratory data analysis, model development, and an interactive web interface, users can gain insights into their happiness determinants and see how they compare on a global scale.

### Data Source

The project utilizes the World Happiness Report dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosmorenohernndez/world-happiness-report-2015-2023), which compiles global happiness metrics across several years. This dataset forms the foundation for our analysis and model development, providing a robust framework for understanding the intricacies of happiness on a global scale.

## <a id="project-structure"></a>Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows to ensure ease of navigation and collaboration:

- **`data/`**: Contains all datasets used in the project.
  - `processed/`: Cleaned and processed data ready for modelling.
  - `raw/`: Original datasets.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation related to the project.
- **`models/`**: Machine learning models including training and evaluation scripts.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the application, including Flask backend and frontend assets.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

To set up your environment to run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/NidaB-C/happiness_project.git`
   
2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional, but recommended):  
   `python -m venv venv`  
   `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac)
   `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
   
4. **Install Dependencies**:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

To use the application and interact with the happiness prediction model:

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory:  
   `cd src/`
   
2. Run the Flask application:  
   `python app.py`
   
3. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the application.

### Logistic Regression Model Summary

The logistic regression model was developed to predict the binary happiness indicator derived from the World Happiness Report data. The model's performance was robust, with an accuracy score of approximately 98.9%. Precision, recall, and F1-scores were consistently high for both the 'happy' (1) and 'not happy' (0) classes, signifying the model's proficient classification capabilities.

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Approximately 98.9%, indicating a high overall rate of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: High for both classes (0.98 for class 0 and 1.00 for class 1), implying a low false-positive rate.
- **Recall**: Perfect (1.00) for class 0 and nearly perfect (0.98) for class 1, reflecting the model's effectiveness in identifying true positives.
- **F1-Score**: Close to 1 for both classes, denoting a balanced precision-recall relationship.
